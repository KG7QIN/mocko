# Mocko
Mocking made easy, proxy your API and choose which endpoints to mock

## Features
- Manage your mocks in a web UI, no complicated configuration files or CLIs
- Proxy your real API: Requests will be passed through to it unless there's a mock
- Create generic and specific mocks:
    - /cats/{name}
    - /cats/george

## When to use?
- Mocking integrations for tests or non-productive environments
- Mocking integrations for local development
- Mocking your own services on development environment to make it easy to simulate
complicated scenarios
- Mocking your future services on development environment to allow the front end and
the back end to develop in parallel (after that, remove the mock and it'll be proxied
to the real service) 

## Installation
### Using Helm
Installation on your Kubernetes cluster using helm is pretty simple:
```
helm repo add cdt https://cdn.codetunnel.net/helm

helm install cdt/mocko -n mocko --set \
        redis.host=YOUR.REDIS.HOST, \
        redis.password=YOUR_REDIS_PASSWORD, \
        proxy.uri=http://your-real-api.url/v1
```

### Docker Compose complete stack
Not documented yet ðŸ˜¬

### Docker Compose standalone mode
Not documented yet ðŸ˜¬


## Usage
You can create, delete and update mocks in the UI when using the complete stack
mode (or when installing with helm).

For standalone mode, check [mocko-proxy's README.md](https://github.com/gabriel-pinheiro/mocko/blob/master/mocko-proxy/README.md)
