# Getting Started
with Complete Stack

---

## Installation
Let's get started with Mocko Complete, a installation of mock with an
UI that will make it as easy as possible to manage your mocks.

<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
  You need Docker and docker-compose for this installation
</div>

First clone Mocko's repository and `cd` into it:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/mocko-app/mocko.git
cd mocko
```

Now up your compose, on Linux or Mac, if you're not in the `docker`
group, you might need `sudo`:
```shell
docker-compose up
```

And... That's it, access http://localhost:8080
to use the UI. Your mocks will be served on `localhost:8081`.
## Next steps
Before moving on, how about leaving us a star on GitHub? It'll take you
two clicks, first [here](https://cdt.one/jscrqNk) and
then on star :)

Now that you have Mocko up and running, it's time to learn the main
functionality of Mocko: templating. With it, you can create dynamic
mocks, write logic for them so that you can simulate the more
complicated scenarios. See you there :)
